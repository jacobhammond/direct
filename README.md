# DIRECT: Digital Interface for Real-time Estimation of Commute and Transit
![logo](direct/src/logo.png)

## About
Commuters that use public transit recognize how important it is to accurately estmate travel times. A
slight miscalculation can completely comprise what was supposed to be a quick and efficient commute
and lead to delays and consequences such as missing appointments or being late to work. It is common
for public transit providers to post schedules for buses and subways, but many riders will testify that these
schedules are rarely accurate and seldom even followed. Delays, traffic, and a variety of factors can easily
shake up the planned schedule and have a buterfly effect causing the entire days’ worth of departure and
arrivals to inch later and later. Many riders atempt to avoid this headache by using third-party map
applications, which atempt to fetch real-time transit data and estimate the most efficient route – but
these depersonalized tools are also often inaccurate and are usually suited for providing an estimate based
on historical trips giving users only a best guess of what route they should take.
This project proposes an embedded system that can accurately calculate commute information in real-time
for a single user that is personalized and programmed to handle real-time calculations of the most used
routes. The system would provide a level of granularity lacking from other tools by targeting specific routes
to provide actual optimization of those routes, rather than estimations or best guesses. The system would
calculate departure times and notify the user in near real-time if there are changes, delays, or beter routes
available without the user having to view schedules, or manually refresh a myriad of transit pages.
